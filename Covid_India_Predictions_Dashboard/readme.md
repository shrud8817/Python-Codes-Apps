DEATH PREDICTION TRENDS
Non linear mixed effects model with and locational variations in random effects.Data is modelled from available national and global sources up to current date. Predictions are made for a 14 day (2 week) interval. We have made state specific model optimization.5 States are modelled namely: Maharashtra, Gujrat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Same model can be applied to other States and UTs also.

Inputs: Deaths daily (TIme series)
Outputs:Log(Cumulative Death Rates)
Inferences: Cumulative Death Rates, Daily Death Rates, Daily Deaths, Cumulative of Daily Deaths (All in TIme Series)


HOSPITAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION BASED ON NUMBER OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS
Based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo we calculate the hospital resource requiremnts. 5 States are modelled namely:Maharashtra, Gujrat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka. Same model can be applied to other States and UTs also.

Inputs: Confirmed Cases daily (Time series)
Outputs: Hospital Beds, ICUs, Ventilators
